# The-Simpler-Scheduler-
Operating Systems I Final Project. The Simple Scheduler is a straightforward console-based program that uses four out of many other scheduling algorithms; First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Priority Scheduling and Round Robin (RR), with the option of using some them in their preemptive or non-preemptive form. It also provides the Gantt Chart of the FCFS algorithm in addition to brief information about a few of the algorithms. The user has the option of writing process details then picking which algorithm to use to calculate the waiting time, turn-around time, response time and context switching. Or they can load processes details from a text file. The application then stores the results in a text file.
